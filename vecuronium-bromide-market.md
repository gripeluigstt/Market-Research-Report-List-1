<p><strong>The Vecuronium Bromide Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surgery</li><li>Tracheal Intubation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vecuronium bromide is a neuromuscular blocking agent primarily used in surgical settings and for tracheal intubation. In surgery, it facilitates muscle relaxation, allowing for optimal conditions during procedures, particularly in abdominal and thoracic operations. For tracheal intubation, vecuronium aids in the successful placement of the endotracheal tube by temporarily paralyzing the patient's muscles, enhancing airway management and reducing the risk of complications. Its application ensures smoother anesthesia induction and improved surgical outcomes.</p></p>
